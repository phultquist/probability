# statFinder
I made this for my stats class! Any function can be written in simluate() and the code will graph the experimental probability — or the percent of trials so far that have ended with a 1. 

# current code
The code that is in there is set up for this problem:

100 passengers board an airplane with exactly 100 seats. Everyone has a ticket with an assigned seat number.
However, the first passenger has lost their ticket and takes a random seat. Every subsequent passenger attempts to choose their own seat, but takes a random seat if their’s is taken.
Suppose you are the very last passenger to board the plane. What is the probability that the last person gets their assigned seat?

I had no idea how to do this one... so I simulated it with Processing. Put anything in the simulate() function!
